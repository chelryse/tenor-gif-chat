Hey! Welcome to Tenor GIF to Chat.

Yeah, thereâ€™s another module out there that does the same thing, but this oneâ€™s faster, lighter, and compact. Instead of relying on Glyph, this module uses Tenor, which powers GIFs on platforms like Discord, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, and more. So if you're already used to Tenorâ€™s GIF library, youâ€™ll feel right at home. It also works with PopOut! module and similar functions to let it float as a separete window, always having a reaction at reach. 

Due to Tenorâ€™s API rules, I canâ€™t provide my own API key â€” misuse could get it suspended or banned, and nobody wants that headache.

Once you install and enable the module, head over to your Foundry settings (Modules tab), and plug in your own Tenor API key. Itâ€™s quick, free, and easy to get here:

Like the module? You can buy me a coffe in appreciation! It helps make me spend my time refining this and future-to-come new modules! https://ko-fi.com/collegeofdevbard
